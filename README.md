# Age-Detection-Using-CNN
This GitHub repository contains Python code for an age detection program implemented using deep learning techniques. The code includes data preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and prediction steps. The model architecture is based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) optimized for regression tasks.
